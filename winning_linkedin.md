Here’s how to get a remote job RIGHT NOW!

1. Get your remote job application package ready for applying to remote jobs:

A stand-out resume;
A stand-out online profile;
A few great go-to responses for those open-ended questions on application forms;
A few professional references;
Be honest about why you really want a remote job;

There are so many reasons people choose to work remotely, but for me, working remotely is all about living my life the way I want to live it.

2. Start your remote job search. 
Use social media for networking and proactively reach out to connections.

3. Crush the remote interview process by being prepared for that dream remote job interview.

4. Send thank-you notes to all interviewers.

5. Follow up politely if you don’t hear anything.

6. If you want to travel and work remotely, let me know. I'd love to help you make it happen.
